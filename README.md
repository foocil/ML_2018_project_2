## Structure
The raw data are in the `data` folder.
The training set should be named `data_train.csv` and the sample submission set `sample_submission.csv`.

The output go to the `reports` folder.

The `notebooks` folder contains the Jupyter notebooks we used to develop, test and debug our project.

The core of this project is in the `src` folder.
The models are in `src/models` and the data processing are in `src/data`.
